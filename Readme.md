The application can be configured using `appsettings.json`. The Testero web app requires the following settings, which are already present in the provided `appsettings.json` file:

    "ConnectionStrings": {
        "DefaultConnection": "Data Source=SQLLiteDatabase.db"
      }
      "RequestLogging": {
        "LogFilePath": "Requests.txt"
      },
      "Tasks": {
        "CriticalLogPath": "CriticalTasks.txt"
      }

Here are the steps to set up the project:

 1.  **Open Solution and Restore Dependencies**:
-   Use Visual Studio 2022 to open the solution.
-   Restore dependencies using NuGet.

 2.  **Database Setup**:
-   An empty, initialized SQLite database is provided with the project.
-   If you prefer to use a different database, create a new file and initialize it using the provided migrations
        
        `dotnet ef database update`
 
 3. **Run Testero web app**
- Open the project in Visual Studio and run it as debug.
- Open your web browser and navigate to index.html. By default, the Swagger page will be displayed.
- If you see a plain and empty page with some green and orange elements, try creating new tasks to populate it.
